# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Image Classification

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. It supports precision agriculture by providing an early, automated solution for identifying crop diseases.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Thousands of high-resolution leaf images labeled by disease and crop type
- Classes include: Early blight, Mosaic virus, Powdery mildew, Bacterial spot, and more
- Crops include: Tomato, Potato, Bell Pepper

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Build a CNN model to classify plant diseases from image data
- Improve model generalization using data augmentation and normalization
- Evaluate and visualize model performance using standard metrics and plots
- Deploy model for real-world use in agricultural diagnostics

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Key Features
- CNN model trained on thousands of augmented and preprocessed plant images
- Image normalization, resizing, stratified train-test splits for improved learning
